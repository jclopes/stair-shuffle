# stair-shuffle
A better way to randomize a deck of cards.

If you play a collectible card game like MTG (magic the gathering), android: netrunner or any other cardgame or boardgame. You probably don't want to bend your cards to riffle shuffle them.

The technique that I present here produces a better randomization than riffle shuffle and at the same time spares your cards from torture.

Check the video here.

You can try out the jupyter notebook and experiment with different shuffle techniques.
